                </li>


                <li><strong> REMEDIES. </strong> CONSULTANT and NGT agrees that the remedy at law for any breach by either party of any provision of Sections 4 and/or 6 (including Schedule B) will be by independent Mediation/Arbitration  (pursuant to Section 11 and 12 below). The covenants in this Agreement are independent, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of CONSULTANT against NGT, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of these covenants by NGT.
                </li>


                <li><strong>WAIVER TO RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY. </strong>  All parties waive the right to trial by jury in any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Choice of MEDITATION/ARBITRATOR.  </strong>   Both parties choose independent mediation or arbitrator. Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and legal cost at all levels. </li>
                <li><strong>APPLICABLE LAWS / VENUE. </strong> This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas and exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute shall lie solely in the state courts of Hood County, Texas, or the federal courts in the district in which Hood County sits, to whose jurisdiction CONSULTANT and NGT irrevocably submits itself and waives any objections to venue. </li>
                <li><strong>WAIVER. </strong>    The failure of either party to enforce, at any time or for any period of time, any provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or the right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions.   </li>
                <li><strong>CONTRACT CHANGES FOR PROSPECTIVE LEGAL EVENTS. </strong>   The parties acknowledge that this Agreement has been negotiated and entered into effect in compliance with the provisions of the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Statute, 42 U.S.C.§ 1320a-7b(b), the “Stark Law,” 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn, and all other applicable laws and regulations. In the event that any law is adopted or amended, or any rule or regulation is promulgated or modified, or any administrative ruling or judicial interpretation is issued or modified that, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel to NGT and CONSULTANT, prohibits arrangements similar or analogous to those specified in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall renegotiate and restructure this Agreement in a manner intended to comply with such law, rule, ruling, regulation or interpretation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>HEALTH CARE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. </strong>    CONSULTANT represents and warrants that CONSULTANT has never been excluded from participation in any federal or state health care program, including without limitation Medicare and Medicaid, and that no action of any type to effect such exclusion is currently pending against CONSULTANT or it’s EMPLOYEE. CONSULTANT shall immediately notify NGT of any investigation or any circumstances which may result in CONSULTANT or any of its Employees being excluded from participating in any federal or state health care program. If CONSULTANT or one of its Employees is excluded from participating in any federal or state health care program, NGT shall have the option of immediately terminating this Agreement.

                <li><strong>SEVERABILITY. </strong>    If any term, clause or provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other term, clause or provision and such invalid term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from the Agreement.
                </li>
                <li><strong> NOTICES. </strong>  All notices, consents, requests, claims, demands, instructions or other communications given or made hereunder by NGT or CONSULTANT shall be in writing and personally delivered or transmitted by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by express mail to the parties at the following addresses:  </li>

          <h4>EXHIBIT A</h4>
          <h4>SALES AND MARKETING CODE OF CONDUCT OF<br>
            NEX GEN TESTING, INC.
          </h4>
          <p>Nex Gen Testing, Inc. (NGT) will conduct its business honestly and ethically wherever we operate in the world. We will constantly improve the quality of our services, products and operations and will create a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust and sound business judgment.  No illegal or unethical conduct on the part of officers, directors, employees or affiliates will be tolerated.   NGT will not compromise its principles for short-term advantage. The ethical performance of this company is the sum of the ethics of the men and women who work for NGT. Thus, we are all expected to adhere to high standards of personal integrity.
          </p>

          <h5>Written Procedures and Policies:</h5>
          <p>NGT has adopted written policies that promote our commitment to compliance and that address specific areas of potential fraud, such as billing, marketing and claims processing. These policies have been developed under the supervision and direction of NGT’s Chief Compliance Officer and has been provided to all individuals who are affected by the specific policy at issue.</p>


          <h5>Standards of Conduct: </h5>
          <p>NGT has developed this Sales and Marketing Standard of Conduct for all its employees and affiliates (including independent sales CONSULTANTs and companies providing sales CONSULTANT services to NGT) to clearly delineate the policies of NGT with respect to sales and marketing and to assure adherence to all guidelines and regulations governing federally funded health care programs. This Sales and Marketing Standard of Conduct will be made available to and understandable by all employees and affiliates involved in sales and marketing, and will be regularly updated as the policies and regulations of these programs are modified. Strict adherence to compliance policies and applicable legal requirements is a condition of employment or contractual engagement.</p>


          <h2 class="exhibit_heading">NGT WILL TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION, UP TO AND INCLUDING TERMINATION, FOR VIOLATION OF THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.</h2>


          <h5>Sales and Marketing:</h5>
          <p> NGT requires honest, straightforward, fully informative and non-deceptive marketing. NGT believes that it is in the best interest of patients, physicians, Medicare and NGT alike that physicians fully understand the services offered by NGT, the services that will be provided when tests are ordered, and the financial consequences for Medicare, as well as other payers, for the tests ordered. Accordingly, all of NGT’s marketing information will be clear, correct, non-deceptive and fully informative. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates will refrain from gathering competitor intelligence by illegitimate means and refrain from acting on knowledge or information which has been gathered in such a manner. The officers, directors, employees and affiliates of NGT will seek to avoid exaggerating or disparaging comparisons of the services and competence of their competitors. </p>

          <h5> Medical Necessity:</h5>
          <p> NGT will only submit claims to federally funded health care programs for services that NGT has reason to believe are medically necessary. While NGT does not and cannot treat patients or make medical necessity determinations, NGT is in a unique position to educate our physician clients regarding the requirement of medical necessity for each test ordered. NGT’s requisition forms will emphasize physician choice and encourage physicians to order, to the extent possible, only those tests that they believe are appropriate for each patient. When NGT creates a custom profile for a physician, the requesting physician will be required to sign an acknowledgement that the physician has requested the custom profile; has been provided Medicare reimbursement amount for each test; has been told to order medically necessary tests only; understands that some tests may not be reimbursed; and has the right to not use the custom profile and order tests differently for any patient.
          </p>

          <h5> Kickbacks and Gifts:  </h5>
          <p>Officers, directors, employees and affiliates of the company must never permit their personal interests to conflict, or appear to conflict, with the interests of NGT, its clients or affiliates. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates must be particularly careful to avoid representing NGT in any transaction with others with whom there is any outside business affiliation or personal or family relationship. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates shall avoid using their company contacts to advance their private business or personal interests at the expense of NGT, its clients or affiliates. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates will avoid conflicts of interests which could interfere with their ability to deliver quality products or services to the company and its clients. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates involved in sales and marketing activities must annually report any actual or potential conflicts of interest by completing a Conflict of Interest Disclosure form.  In addition, any time a potential conflict arises, a new Conflict of Interest Disclosure must be completed. In addition, when an officer, director, employee or affiliate is faced with a potential conflict of interest, he or she should seek guidance from the Chief Compliance Officer before proceeding. Whenever an officer, director, employee or affiliate has a question about whether a situation presents a conflict, he or she should contact the Chief Compliance Officer.
          </p>


          <h5> Conflicts of Interest:</h5>
          <p>        Federal and State Anti-Kickback statutes are violated when payment is given or received in exchange for the referral of patients who are covered under federal health care programs, such as Medicare, unless a statutory exception applies.  Harsh criminal, civil and monetary penalties can result.  A kick back is considered any item of value, or compensation of any kind, to improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment. Consistent with Federal and State law, NGT does not permit bribes, kickbacks or other similar remuneration or consideration to be given to any person or organization in order to attract or influence business activity. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates shall avoid gifts, gratuities, fees, bonuses, or excessive entertainment to attract or influence business activity. Excessive entertainment is defined as any amount in excess of guidelines determined annually by Medicare/CMS.  Officers, directors, employees and affiliates shall refrain from using offers of equipment, computer hardware, computer software, support staff and other non-monetary gifts that deviate from accepted business practices authorized by NGT and incorporated into company sponsored sales training. It is NGT’s policy that non-monetary gifts to physicians must meet exceptions defined in the Stark Law:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> The compensation is not determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician. </li>
            <li> The compensation may not be solicited by the physician or the physician's practice (including employees and staff members). </li>
            <li> The compensation arrangement does not violate the Anti-Kickback statute or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission. </li>
            <li> The compensation may not exceed annual limits established by Medicare/CMS in the aggregate per calendar year.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Officers, directors, employees and affiliates cannot attempt to control or improperly influence a physician’s decision as to which clinical laboratory to use for the testing of patient specimens. The decision as to which clinical laboratory to use is to be made solely by the referring physician.</p>

          <h2 class="exhibit_heading">ANY ATTEMPT TO CONTROL OR IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE A REFERRAL TO NGT WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION, UP TO AND INCLUDING TERMINATION.  </h2>

          <p>In order to effectively monitor compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, NGT also prohibits CONSULTANTs, working under an Independent Contractor Group who is subject to a Representation Agreement with NGT, from employing any regular employees or independent contractors for the solicitation and sales of NGT products and services.
          </p>


          <h5>Excluded Individuals and Companies:</h5>
          <p>NGT will not employ or contract with individuals or companies who have been convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are listed by a Federal agency as debarred, excluded or otherwise ineligible for participation in federally funded health care programs. In addition, until resolution of such criminal charges or proposed debarment or exclusion, individuals who are charged with criminal offenses related to health care or proposed for exclusion or debarment will be removed from direct responsibility for or involvement in any federally funded health care program. If resolution results in conviction, debarment or exclusion of the individual, NGT will immediately terminate its employment of that individual or company.</p>

          <h5>Confidentiality:</h5>
          <p> Officers, directors, employees and affiliates of NGT will often come into contact with, or have possession of, trade secret, proprietary, confidential or business-sensitive information and must take appropriate steps to ensure that such information is strictly safeguarded. This information – whether it is on behalf of our company or any of our clients, referral sources, suppliers, vendors or affiliates – could include strategic business plans, operating results, marketing strategies, customer lists, personnel records, upcoming acquisitions and divestitures, new investments, and manufacturing costs, processes and methods. Trade secrets, proprietary, confidential and sensitive business information about this company, other companies, individuals and entities should be treated with sensitivity and discretion and only be disseminated on a need-to-know basis. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates will refrain from using or disclosing the trade secrets or confidential, proprietary information of third parties, unless such information is in the public domain or was disclosed by someone who was authorized to disclose such information to NGT. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates will comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (referred to as HIPAA) with respect to the use and disclosure of patient health information (PHI).</p>

          <h5>Reporting:</h5>
          <p> Officers, directors, employees and affiliates will seek to report all information accurately and honestly, and as otherwise required by applicable reporting requirements. Officers, directors, employees and affiliates agree to timely disclose or report unethical, dishonest, fraudulent and illegal behavior, or the violation of company policies and procedures, directly to management or the Chief Compliance Officer. In addition, NGT has a hotline telephone number that can be used to anonymously report suspected misconduct.   NGT has an open door, complete anonymity, non-retribution policy available to all officers, directors, employees and affiliates to encourage communication and reporting of suspected misconduct.</p>

          <h5>Disciplinary Action:</h5>
          <p> Violation of this Code of Conduct can result in discipline, including possible termination or termination of contractual agreements to represent NGT. The degree of discipline may relate in part to whether there was a voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.</p>
