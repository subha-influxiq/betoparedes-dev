          <h1>The Importance of PCR Testing</h1>
          <p>When it comes to infectious diseases, Time, Accuracy, and Antibiotic Resistance matter!Molecular PCR "Polymerase Chain Reaction"  using RNA & DNA sequencing quickly identifies pathogens and detects potential antibiotic resistance so effective treatment can begin sooner. <span>Molecular PCR pathogen testing provides identification of the antibiotic resistance results the next business day for up to 99% of the pathogens responsible for Common Respiratory, Urinary tract, GI tract, Wound, and Nail Infections. Faster results than traditional culture & sensitivity can help patients get well faster, help to prevent antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance, and reduce unnecessary complications that might result in either hospital admissions or increased cost. This can be especially important in the elderly or immunocompromised patients.</span><span class="bigtextwrapper">PCR technology precisely identifies pathogens in 1 day</span>In conclusion through technological innovation we are transforming infectious disease detection and response for America’s health.
