          <h1>Our History</h1>
          <p>The NexGen founders started out in the Health and Life Insurance industry, recruiting and training national sales teams. The changes in that industry, as well as the medical field, put the founders in a position to form this company to provide excellent service to a different type of client, the Physician. As technology adapted and changed, more testing and tools came to the market. As a result, companies and laboratories are in need of a national sales force to get their products and services into the physicians & clinics hand. This is what NexGen Testing specializes in.</p>
