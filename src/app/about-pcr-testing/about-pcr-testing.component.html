      <h1>Why PCR Testing is replacing Culture & Sensitivity, Results in 1 Day!</h1>
      <p>When it comes to infectious diseases, Time, Accuracy, and Antibiotic Resistance matter! Molecular PCR "Polymerase Chain Reaction"  using RNA & DNA sequencing quickly identifies pathogens and detects potential antibiotic resistance so effective treatment can begin sooner <span>Molecular PCR pathogen testing provides 24-hour identification and antibiotic resistance results for up to 99% of the pathogens responsible for Common Respiratory, Urinary tract, GI tract, Wound, and Nail Infections. Faster results than traditional culture & sensitivity can help
patients get well faster, help to prevent antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance, and reduce unnecessary complications that might result in either hospital admissions or increased cost. This can be especially important in the elderly or immunocompromised patients.</span> Below are a dozen reasons why Physicians, Hospitals. Skilled Nursing Facilities, Clinics, and Nursing Homes are using Molecular PCR testing.
