    <h2>The Process:</h2>
    <h3>The process, whether introductory sales, platform sales or enterprise sales follows the exact same process for the most point.</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
       The potential prospect is scheduled with you for a quick “Opportunity Review”.

      </li>

      <li>
      In the opportunity review you take them through the media deck for the opportunity. This should be framed as an introduction.
      </li>

      <li>
        During the “Opportunity Review” you focus on closing them on a scheduled “Discovery Call” with the members of our closing desk. (These are the CEOs and VP of Sales of the various opportunities you represent). We highly suggest you have the backoffice open so that you can schedule this quickly.

      </li>

      <li>
        You are to qualify their interest in this discovery. In other words, you are closing, but you are closing them on the experience they will get when they get onto the discovery.

      </li>

      <li>
        There are different requirements that need to be reviewed in our resource center for each of the sales opportunities we represent. For example, Priority Commercial Payments requires either a CFO, CEO or head of finance to be the one on the call. They also require that the company is at least a 30 million dollar in revenue or higher company. With Universal Tech Associates they require that the technology is a full MVP (Minimal Viable Product) or technology that is already fully functional. Be sure the properly qualify the prospect based on each opportunity when you are going through the “Opportunity Review”

      </li>

      <li>
        Once qualified add the new company and the appointment time to the “Discovery Calendar”. This will send out a calendar invite with the web cast meeting line and date/time for the “Discovery Call” with the closing desk.

      </li>

      <li>
        Be sure to add to the notes field any notes that may help the closing desk understand the prospect better.  These are emailed to them directly to prepared for the call.
      </li>

      <li>
       Please do send personal texts and email reminders to your prospect to help assure they are going to attend the call. Our system will also send reminders, but this personal touch is very helpful.
      </li>

      <li>
        You are required to be present on discovery calls in order to introduce the new potential client to the closing desk principal.

      </li>

    </ul>
