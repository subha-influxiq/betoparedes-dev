NGTâ€™s requisition forms will emphasize physician choice and encourage physicians to order, to the extent possible, only those tests that they believe are appropriate for each patient. When NGT creates a custom profile for a physician, the requesting physician will be required to sign an acknowledgement that the physician has requested the custom profile; has been provided Medicare reimbursement amount for each test; has been told to order medically necessary tests only; understands that some tests may not be reimbursed; and has the right to not use the custom profile and order tests differently for any patient.
